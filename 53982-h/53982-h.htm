<h2>REMAINS AT MONASTERBOICE. COUNTY LOUTH.</h2>

<p>To the observing and imaginative traveller, our island must
present a great number of peculiarities of aspect which
will not fail to excite his notice, and impress themselves indelibly
upon his mind. The scantiness of wood&mdash;for its natural
timber has nearly all disappeared&mdash;and the abundance
of water, are two of the characteristics that will most strike
him; and, next to these, the great extent of prospect usually
afforded to the eye in consequence of the undulating character
of its surface. Sparkling streams are visible everywhere,
and shining lakes and noble rivers come into view in rapid succession;
while ranges of blue mountains are rarely wanting
to bound the distant horizon. The colours with which Nature
has painted the surface of our island are equally peculiar.
There is no variety of green, whether of depth or vivid brightness,
which is not to be found covering it; they are hues which
can be seen nowhere else in equal force; and even our bogs,
which are so numerous, with all their mutations of colour,
now purple, and anon red, or brown, or black, by their vigorous
contrasts give additional beauty and life to the landscape,
and assist in imparting to it a sort of national individuality.
Our very clouds have to a great degree a distinctive
character&mdash;the result of the humidity of our climate;
they have a grandeur of form and size, and a force of light
and shadow, that are but rarely seen in other countries; they
are <em>Irish clouds</em>&mdash;at one moment bright and sunny, and in the
next flinging their dark shadows over the landscape, and involving
it in gloomy grandeur. It is in this striking force of
contrast in almost every thing that we look at, that the peculiarity
of our scenery chiefly consists; and it appears to have
stamped the general character of our people with those contrasting
lights and shades so well exhibited in our exquisite
and strongly-marked national music, in which all varieties of
sentiment are so deeply yet harmoniously blended as to produce
on the mind effects perhaps in some degree saddening,
but withal most delightfully sweet and soothing. A country
marked with such peculiarities is not the legitimate abode of
the refined sensualist of modern times, or the man of artificial
pleasure and heartless pursuits, and all such naturally
remain away from it, or visit it with reluctance; but it is the
proper habitation of the poet, the painter, and, above all,
the philanthropist; for nowhere else can the latter find so
extensive a field for the exercise of the godlike feelings of
benevolence and patriotism.</p>

<p>Yet the natural features of scenery and climate which we
have pointed out, interesting as all must admit them to be,
are not the only ones that confer upon our country the peculiar
and impressive character which it possesses. The relics of
past epochs of various classes; the monuments of its Pagan
times, as revealed to us in its religious, military, and sepulchral
remains; the ruins of its primitive Christian ages, as
exemplified in its simple and generally unadorned churches,
and slender round towers; the more splendid monastic edifices
of later date, and the gloomy castles of still more recent
times&mdash;these are everywhere present to bestow historic interest
on the landscape, and bring the successive conditions
and changes of society in bygone ages forcibly before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
mind; so that an additional interest, of a deep and poetical
nature, is thus imparted to views in themselves impressive
from their wild and picturesque appearance. So perfect, indeed,
is this harmony of the natural and artificial characteristics
of Irish scenery, so comprehensively do both tell the history
of our country, to which Nature has been most bountiful,
and in which, alas! man has not been happy, that if we were
desirous of giving a stranger a true idea of Ireland, and one
that would impress itself on his mind, we should conduct him
to one of our green open landscapes, where the dark and ruined
castle, seated on some rocky height, or the round tower, with
its little parent church, in some sequestered valley, would be
the only features to arrest his attention; and of such a scene
we should say emphatically, This is Ireland! And such a
scene is that which is presented by the ruins represented in
our prefixed illustration.</p>

<p>Passing along the great northern road from Drogheda to
Dundalk, and about four miles from the former, the traveller
will find himself in an open pastoral country, finely undulating,
thinly dotted with the cottages of the peasants, and but little
adorned by art. On one side, to his left, he will see a little
group of ruins, with a lofty but shattered round tower, giving
index of their age and character. These are the ruins of
the long since celebrated religious establishment of Monasterboice,
one of the most interesting groups of their kind in Ireland.
They consist of two small churches, a round tower,
and three most gorgeously sculptured stone crosses, standing
in the midst of a crowd of tombs and head-stones of various
ages. Both the churches are of great antiquity, though, as
their architectural features clearly show, of widely separated
ages&mdash;the larger one exhibiting the peculiarities of the ecclesiastical
structures of the twelfth century, and the smaller
those of a much earlier date. Both are also simple oblongs,
consisting of a nave and choir; and the round tower appears
to be of coeval architecture with the earlier church.</p>

<p>The tower, which is of excellent construction, is built of the
slatey limestone of the surrounding hills, and is divided into five
stories by belts of stone slightly projecting. The upper story
has four oblong apertures, and the lower ones are each lighted
by an aperture having an angular top. The doorway, which
faces the south-east, has a semicircular arch, and is constructed
of chiselled freestone: it is of the usual height of
five feet six inches, by one foot ten inches in breadth, and is
six feet from the present surface of the ground. The circumference
of the tower is fifty-one feet, and its height is one hundred
and ten; but its original height was greater, as a considerable
portion of its top has been destroyed by lightning.</p>

<p>In these churches and this tower Monasterboice has nothing
which may not be found in many other early religious foundations
in Ireland; but in the magnificence of its sculptured
stone crosses it may be said to stand alone. They are the
finest of their class in the country; but, as we shall make them
the subjects of distinct notices, with illustrations, in our
future numbers, it is not necessary for us to enter into a more
particular description of them here.</p>

<p>Monasterboice, or, as it is called in the Irish language,
Mainistir-buite&mdash;that is, the monastery of Buite, or Boetius&mdash;owes
its origin to a celebrated bishop and abbot of this name
who flourished about the close of the fifth century, and who is
said to have been a disciple of St Patrick: according to our
ancient annalists, he died on the 7th of December 522. Of
its subsequent history but little is preserved, beyond a few
scattered records of the deaths of several of its abbots and
professors anterior to the twelfth century, of whom the celebrated
poet, antiquary, and historian, Flann, was the most
distinguished, and whose death is thus recorded in the Annals
of the Four Masters:&mdash;</p>

<p>“1056. Flann of the Monastery, lecturer of Monasterboice,
the last fountain of knowledge of the Irish, in history, poetry,
eloquence, and general literature, died on the fourth of the
calends of December (28th November), of whom it was said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘Flann of the great church of sweet Buite,</div>
<div class="verse">The piercing eyes of his smooth head were modest;</div>
<div class="verse">The godly man of Meath was he of whom we speak;</div>
<div class="verse">The last professor of the country of the three Finns was Flann.’”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A considerable number of historical poems by this distinguished
man have descended to our times, of which a list is
given in O’Reilly’s Irish Writers; but his more valuable remains
are his Synchronisms of the Irish Kings, with the
Eastern and Roman Emperors, and of the Christian Provincial
Kings of Ireland, and the Kings of Scotland of the Irish
race, with the Chief Monarchs of Ireland. Of these works,
which are of inestimable value to the Irish and Scottish historian,
perfect copies are preserved in the MS. Book of Lecan,
in the Library of the Royal Irish Academy.</p>

<p>The notices in our Annals of the other distinguished men
connected with Monasterboice are of little interest; but as
they have never been properly collected together, we think
them worthy of publication, for the use of the Irish topographical
historian, to whom we trust our Journal will become a
valuable repertory of authorities:</p>

<p>722. Ailchon, of Monasterboice, died.</p>

<p>769. Cormac, the son of Ailliolla, Abbot of Monasterboice,
was drowned in the Boyne.</p>

<p><a href="#transnote" title="See note">786.</a> Dubdainber, the son of Cormac, Abbot of Monasterboice,
died.</p>

<p>800. Cuanna, Abbot of Monasterboice, died.</p>

<p>836. Flaithri, Abbot of Monasterboice, a Bishop and Anchorite,
died.</p>

<p>844. Muireadhach, the son of Flann, Abbot of Monasterboice,

<p>853. Radgus, the son of Maicniada, Abbot of Monasterboice,

<p>864. Colga and Aodh, two Abbots of Monasterboice, died
this year.</p>

<p>887. Fothaidh, Abbot of Monasterboice, died.</p>

<p>922. Muireadhach, the son of Donall, Abbot of Monasterboice,

and the stewart of Patrick’s people, from Sliabh Fuaid (the
Fews Mountain) to Leinster, died.</p>

<p>1039. Macniadha, a Bishop, and Abbot of Monasterboice,

<p>1059. Donall, the son of Eodhossa, Abbot of Monasterboice,
died.</p>

<p>1067. Echtigern, the son of Flann, Aircinneach of Monasterboice,
died.</p>

<p>1117. Eogan, the son of Echtigern, Abbot of Monasterboice,
died.</p>

<p>These notices, extracted from the Annals of Ulster, and of
the Four Masters, will show the great antiquity of the Abbey
of Monasterboice, as well as the distinguished rank which it
held among the religious establishments of Ireland previous
to the occupation of the ancient kingdom of Meath by the
English, after which period it disappears from history.</p>

<p>The following records from the same authorities relate to
its general history:&mdash;</p>

<p>968. Monasterboice and Lan Lere were plundered on the
Danes by Donall, King of Ireland, and he burned three hundred
and fifty of them in one house.</p>

<p>1097. The <i>Cloictheach</i> (viz. round tower belfry) of Monasterboice,
containing books and several other valuables, was
burned.</p>

<p>This last notice, and many others of the kind which occur in
our Annals, are of great value in showing the original uses of
our round towers, as set forth in Mr Petrie’s Essay on the
Round Towers of Ireland, now in course of publication.</p>

<p>In concluding these notices of a spot so long the abode of the
piety, art, and learning of remote times, we may add, that in
its present deserted and ruined state it is a scene of the deepest
and most solemn interest; and the mind must indeed be dull
and earthly in which it fails to awaken feelings of touching
and permanent interest. Silence and solitude the most profound
are impressed on all its time-worn features; we are among
the dead only; and we are forced, as it were, to converse
with the men of other days. In all our frequent visits to these
ruins we never saw a living human being among them but
once. It was during a terrific thunder-storm, which obliged
us to seek shelter behind one of the stone crosses for an hour.
The rain poured down in impetuous torrents, and the clouds
were so black as to give day the appearance of night. It was
at such an awful hour, that a woman of middle age, finely
formed, and of a noble countenance, entered the cemetery,
and, regardless of the storm raging around, flung herself
down upon a grave, and commenced singing an Irish lamentation
in tones of heart-rending melancholy and surpassing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
beauty. This wail she carried on as long as we remained;
and her voice coming on the ear between the thunder-peals,
had an effect singularly wild and unearthly: it would be
fruitless to attempt a description of it. The reader, if he know
what an Irishwoman’s song of sorrow is, must imagine the effect
it would have at such a moment among those lightning-shattered
ruins, and chanted by such a living vocal monument of
human woe and desolation.</p>

<p>We subsequently learned on inquiry that this poor creature’s
history was a sad one; she was slightly crazed, in consequence
of the death of her only son, who had been drowned;
and her mania lay in a persuasion, which nothing could remove,
that he was not lost, but would yet return to her to bless her,
and close her long-weeping eyes in peace.</p>

<h3>SECOND ARTICLE.</h3>

<p>We could relate many instances of the gratitude with which
Indians repay a kindness, and of their firmness in friendship,
but our limits restrain us. We must besides admit, that they
are equally resentful of injury as mindful of favours, and
persecute an enemy with as much constancy as they cherish
a friend. Mr Catlin has preserved the portrait of a Mandan
chief, named Mah-to-tôh-pa, or the Four Bears, whose
life affords many singular illustrations of the above truths.
We have room for one only. His brother had been surprised
while asleep by a Riccaree, who left the spear with
which he had murdered the sleeping man in the wound,
and boasted of what he had done. The Four Bears took possession
of the spear, preserved it carefully, with the blood of
his brother encrusted on its point, and swore to cover that
stain with the heart’s blood of the Riccaree. Many moons
elapsed, many snows even went by, and the Four Bears had
not yet found the much desired opportunity of revenge. At
length the <em>culpability</em> of his enforced delay became too heavy
a reproach, and he resolved on seeking the Riccaree in his
distant home, to do which he had to steal his way through his
enemy’s country for hundreds of miles; a task, the difficulty of
which can be appreciated only by those who know the watchfulness
of Indian habits, and the vigilance of those whom he
had to circumvent. But “when Greek meets Greek,” we
all know what “comes;” in this case, however, “diamond-cut-diamond”
were perhaps the more appropriate metaphor:
let our readers settle that point. The Four Bears accomplished
his task; he had traversed many a weary plain,
had threaded many a tangled forest, swam many a river;
but at length he stood, famished and outworn, before the
village of his enemy. This was surrounded by a stockade,
but he overcame that with little difficulty. It was night,
but the dwelling of the offender was known to him, and entering
it, he sat down before the fire, over which hung a
pot containing food, which the provident squaw had set to
simmer through the night. The family were in their beds,
which consist of skins stretched on low frames, and ranged
around the walls of the hut. The Riccaree, the object of the
Mandan’s visit, was also on his couch, with his arms close
beside him, as is the custom. But he was not asleep; the
flame as it rose fitfully was reflected from his glittering eyes,
which rested, but with no particular interest, on his visitor.
The latter, conscious that his then exhausted strength was
not equal to the <em>duty</em> he became to perform, sat collected within
himself for a certain time; he then took part of the food that
filled the pot, and ate in such measure as he thought advisable.
This done, he lighted his pipe, and sat to smoke it.
The squaw meanwhile had asked her husband what man it
was who was reposing at their hearth. “He is a hungry man,
for thou seest he is eating; what matter for the rest?” was her
husband’s reply, and the uninvited guest concluded his meal
without interruption. Was the Mandan shaken by what we
feel to be the most touching appeal of this deep confidence
to his better sympathies? He scarcely felt that it was one.
Among Indians, hospitality is neither offered nor accepted
as a matter of favour, but of right, and of course; nor
would he have replied to such an appeal could he have felt
it. He believed himself to be in the performance of a most
solemn duty, and would have scorned all vacillation as weakness.
Nor shall we be just ourselves if we lose sight of this
in our abhorrence of his deed.</p>

<p>The pipe of the Mandan exhausted, he adjusted his raiment
for departure; he rose, collected his force, sprang on his
unsuspecting host, whom he stabbed to the heart with the spear
already named, then scalped him, and, springing from the hut,
was out of the village, and deep in a neighbouring watercourse,
by the time that his enemies’ dogs were upon him;
again, by many a night march and day of hunger and suffering,
he arrived in his village, <em>his</em> conscience set at rest by the
act at which <em>we</em> shudder.</p>

<p>Mr Catlin, who knew this chief intimately, relates many
stories of his bravery and general elevation of character, but
we have room for the tale of his death only. In the year 1837,
Mr Catlin had left the friendly Mandans some three years,
when the small-pox was carried among them by the traders;
the whole family of the Four Bears perished by this disease;
wife, child, not one was left him; he stood alone in his desolation,
and gathering the corpses together, he covered all with
skins, after the manner of his people; the songs for the dead
then performed, he seated himself by the mound he had raised,
which he addressed from time to time in the most touching
terms of endearment, as each individual composing the mournful
group rose to his memory. This continued through nine
days and nights, during all which he took neither food nor
sleep, and on the tenth he was himself a corpse.</p>

<p>The native American is deeply imbued with religious feeling;
no Indian who maintains a fair character in his tribe is
without some place of retirement for worship and meditation;
a lonely tree, a nook in the bank of a stream, the hollow of a
rock, are frequently selected for this purpose; nor is the
habit confined to such tribes as have no fixed religious ceremonies;
it was practised by the Mandans and others, many of
whom possessed oratories such as we have just described, in
addition to their “medicine” or “mystery lodges,” which may
be called their public temples. The Osages, Kansas, and
other tribes west of the Mississippi, never fail to implore the
blessing of the Great Spirit on breaking up their encampments,
and they return thanks devoutly for the food they have
found, and the preservation they have experienced, on arriving
at the end of their journey. Thanks and praises are also publicly
offered at every new moon, at the commencement of the
buffalo hunts in spring, and at the ingathering of the corn; at
which latter period a feast is held, called the corn feast: over
this, among some tribes, the oldest woman presides. The
Minatarrees boil a large kettle full of the new corn in presence
of all the people, four medicine men, painted with white clay,
dancing round the kettle until its contents are well boiled;
these are next burnt to ashes as an offering to the Great Spirit;
the fire is then extinguished; new fire is immediately created
by rubbing two sticks together; with this they cook the corn
for their own feast, and the remainder of the day is spent in
festivity.</p>

<p>Dances are also performed to the Great Spirit on various
occasions, as among the Ojibbeways on the first fall of snow;
this is danced in snow-shoes. All believe in a future state of
existence&mdash;in the reward of the good by an eternal residence
in pleasant and plentifully supplied hunting grounds beyond
the great waters&mdash;and in the punishment of the wicked by
transformation into some loathsome beast, reptile, or insect,
and by banishment to barren, parched, and desolate regions,
the abodes of bad spirits, for a period proportionate to the enormity
of their guilt. Prayers are also offered to the evil spirit
in deprecation of his enmity, but on none of these ceremonies is
attendance compelled; that Indian is, however, less respected,
who is known constantly to absent himself from all.</p>

<p>The “medicine man” of the Indians is at once prophet,
priest, and physician; he has sometimes great influence. The
ceremony by which this dignity is attained among the Sioux,
is one involving no little suffering. The candidate for this
honour has innumerable splints of wood driven through the
most sensitive parts of his flesh, and being suspended by some
of these to a pole, with his medicine bag in his hand, he is expected
to keep his eyes steadily fixed on the sun from its rising
to its setting, when he is taken down, and entitled to be called
a medicine or mystery man for the remainder of his life; but
he has to make ceaseless efforts for the support of his character,
since the failure of either his cures or his prophecies renders
him liable to universal contempt.</p>

<p>Almost every family has its medicine or mystery bag, which
consists of a beaver or otter skin curiously ornamented; this
contains the medicinal stores and smaller consecrated articles
of the family; it is considered a great disgrace to sell or otherwise
part with an article once consecrated, and the medicine
bag is always held sacred and inviolate to every hand but that
of its owner. When a warrior of the Sac and Fox tribe falls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
in battle, his widow suspends his mystery bag on the pole before
his tent, and sits herself within the lodge; the warriors,
returned from the battle, and adorned with the scalps they
have taken from the enemy, then assemble before the lodge;
they dance to the medicine bag of their lost brother, and
throw presents to his widow, of such articles as they think
may best console her for her loss.</p>

<p>The Indian dwelling is much varied in its form and manner
among the various tribes; the Pawnees, for example, live in
lodges thatched with prairie grass, and which are not unlike
immense bee-hives.</p>

<p>The Sioux, the Camanchees, the Crows, and others inhabiting
a vast tract on the upper waters of the Mississippi and
Missouri rivers, and extending to the base of the Rocky
Mountains, have moveable tents formed of buffalo skins richly
ornamented, according to Indian notions of ornament, and
fastened to poles sometimes twenty-five feet high; some of
these tents will shelter eighty persons, and require from
thirty to thirty-five buffalo skins to cover them.</p>

<p>The Riccarees, Mandans, &amp;c. are, or <em>were</em>, lodged in villages
fortified by strong stockades eighteen feet high; their
huts are formed of poles covered closely and smoothly with
earth, and this in process of time becomes so compact and
hard, that men, women, and children, recline and play on their
tops.</p>

<p>It has been sometimes asserted that the Indian people have
a common language, but this is not the case; scarcely any two
of their nations between whom no intercourse exists, possess
a language understood by both, but this inconvenience is obviated
by a “language of signs,” so effective and eloquent
that by this every Indian is enabled to communicate with his
brother of whatever nation or tribe, and hence perhaps has
arisen the supposition that all speak a common language.
The mode of writing among Indians is entirely hieroglyphic,
and is of course liable to wide misconstruction; but they lay
down maps with no mean degree of accuracy, and the chiefs
wear the boundaries of their hunting-grounds traced on their
robes; a counterpart being kept in the public lodge among
such other records as the nation may possess, and those are
referred to if any dispute arise among neighbouring tribes.</p>

<p>Their manufactures are of course few and simple. Stones
are cut into pestles and mortars, tomahawks, knives, pipes,
&amp;c.; pottery is formed for domestic purposes from the clays
furnished by all parts of their country; mats are woven from
grass or rushes, and blankets from the hair of the buffalo.
These articles are mostly the work of the women, who with
the children plant, cultivate, and gather in the crops, collect
wild rice and pash-e-quah, a large bulbous root, in form like
the sweet potato and in taste like the chesnut, but more juicy.
Nuts of many sorts, several kinds of plums, osage oranges,
gooseberries, strawberries, and many sorts of grapes, are also
collected in their season. Besides this, the women dress buffalo
skins, procure wood and water, and in some tribes fetch home
the game which the hunter, having tracked and killed, then
leaves to their further disposal.</p>

<p>Beaver and other skins, belts of wampum, and coloured
shells ground to an oval form, serve as coin; but the most
important wealth of the Indian is in his horses and dogs, which
assist him in the chase, and of which some possess great
numbers. Many tribes of Indians are exceedingly bold and
expert horsemen, the Camanchees more particularly, many of
whom perform feats of dexterity on their wild horses that
would astonish our boldest equestrians. These men are often
seen to throw themselves on one side of their horses, to avoid
the arrows of an enemy or the attack of an enraged buffalo, in
such a manner that the extremity of one foot only seems to
hold by the animal, and that while he continues to move at
full speed; nay, some have been even known to shoot arrows
while in that position, the tenure of which is altogether inconceivable
to the European rider.</p>

<p>Their weapons for hunting are lances five or six feet long,
and tipped with stone or the bone of some animal, and bows
with arrows similarly pointed. The buffalo is sometimes
hunted by men who have partially concealed their persons in
the skin of the white wolf, and who creep to within shot of
their game by favour of this disguise; for the buffalo, accustomed
to the white wolf, and safe from his attack unless,
when, separated from the herd, he becomes the prey of a pack,
permits the approach of the Indian thus masked, the latter
being careful to keep to leeward of his game, whose scent is
very acute.</p>

<p>Indians sometimes drive whole herds of buffalo, elk, and
deer, into impassable ravines or to the brink of precipices,
when they slaughter as many as they may need; but none were
ever destroyed wantonly before the introduction of whisky;
whereas at this time whole herds are killed merely for their
skins, the flesh being left to decay on the prairies; and this,
by depopulating the hunting-grounds, induces famine, and is
another cause of Indian suffering and final extinction.</p>

<p>Buffaloes are often destroyed by the panther; solitary individuals
sometimes fall a prey to a pack of wolves; others
perish in the burning prairies, that awfully peculiar feature of
the American solitudes; a few are drowned every season in
attempting to cross the ice of rivers not firmly frozen; but
the principal element of their destruction is in the rapacity of
the trader; and it has been calculated that the activity of
this last-named agent will ensure the extermination of this
most valuable creature within a very short period of time.</p>

<p>The education of the Indian child is an object of the most
profound interest, not only to his own family but to the whole
tribe. He is taught to love his country and tribe, to contemn
falsehood, to reverence age, to be modest and silent; he is
strictly enjoined to reward a kindness, but also to avenge an
injury; to aid and guard a friend, but also to injure, by every
means in his power, and relentlessly to persecute, an enemy;
to abhor theft, unless it be practised on the property of an
enemy, when it is called highly meritorious. The sports of
youth are watched attentively by their elders, and all evidences
of cowardice, meanness, &amp;c., are followed by the needful
discipline. The Indian usually retains his mother’s name until
he has entitled himself, by some remarkable act of prowess,
endurance, &amp;c., to choose one for himself, or been distinguished
by some appellation bestowed by the tribe. Some of these
“names” are sufficiently amusing, as, for example, “He
who jumps over every one,” “The very sweet man,” “The
man of good sense,” “No fool,” “The bird that goes to
war,” “He who strikes two at once,” &amp;c. The names of
women are not always inelegant. Take as a specimen of Indian
taste in this matter, “The bending willow,” “The
pure fountain,” “The sweet-scented grass.” Others are
scarcely so complimentary, as, “The female bear,” “The
woman who lives in the bear’s den,” “The creature that
creeps,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>The constancy with which an Indian endures tortures, is
among the best known traits of his character, but his power
of enduring labour has been less insisted on; nay, it has been
denied by those who despair of the civilization of the race, or
who believe that its destruction is a consequence inevitable to
the white man’s progress: but those who so judge know little
of our Red brothers. We could adduce many facts in proof of
this, were our space not wholly exhausted; but we must defer
these, as well as the account we had purposed giving of the
very extraordinary religious ceremonies practised among
some of the tribes. We may, however, possibly return to the
subject at some other time.</p>

<h2 class="gap4" id="THE_IRISH_FIDDLER">THE IRISH FIDDLER.</h2>

<p class="center">BY W. CARLETON.</p>

<p>What a host of light-hearted associations are revived by that
living fountain of fun and frolic, an Irish fiddler! Every thing
connected with him is agreeable, pleasant, jolly. All his anecdotes,
songs, jokes, stories, and secrets, bring us back from
the pressure and cares of life, to those happy days and nights
when the heart was as light as the heel, and both beat time to
the exhilarating sound of his fiddle.</p>

<p>The old harper was a character looked upon by the Irish
rather as a musical curiosity, than a being specially created
to contribute to their enjoyment. There was something about
him which they did not feel to be in perfect sympathy with their
habits and amusements. He was above them, not of them;
and although they respected him, and treated him kindly, yet
was he never received among them with that spontaneous
ebullition of warmth and cordiality with which they welcomed
their own musician, the fiddler. The harper, in fact, belonged
to the gentry, and to the gentry they were willing to leave
him. They listened to his music when he felt disposed to play
for them, but it only gratified their curiosity, instead of enlivening
their hearts&mdash;a fact sufficiently evident from the circumstance
of their seldom attempting to dance to it. This
preference, however, of the fiddle to the harp, is a feeling generated
by change of times and circumstances, for it is well
known that in days gone by, when Irish habits were purer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
older, and more hereditary than they are now, the harp was
the favourite instrument of young and old, of high and low.</p>

<p>The only instrument that can be said to rival the fiddle, is
the bagpipe; but every person knows that Ireland is a loving
country, and that at our fairs, dances, weddings, and other places
of amusement, Paddy and his sweetheart are in the habit of
indulging in a certain quiet and affectionate kind of whisper,
the creamy tones of which are sadly curdled by the sharp jar
of the chanter. It is not, in fact, an instrument adapted for
love-making. The drone is an enemy to sentiment, and it is
an unpleasant thing for a pretty blushing girl to find herself
put to the necessity of bawling out her consent at the top of
her lungs, which she must do, or have the ecstatic words lost in
its drowsy and monotonous murmur. The bagpipe might do
for war, to which, with a slight variation, it has been applied;
but in our opinion it is only fit to be danced to by an assembly
of people who are hard of hearing. Indeed, we have little
doubt but its cultivation might be introduced with good effect
as a system of medical treatment, suitable to the pupils of a
deaf and dumb institution; for if any thing could bring them
to the use of their ears, its sharp and stiletto notes surely
would effect that object.</p>

<p>The fiddle, however, is the instrument of all others most
essential to the enjoyment of an Irishman. Dancing and
love are very closely connected, and of course the fiddle is
never thought of or heard, without awakening the tenderest
and most agreeable emotions. Its music, soft, sweet, and
cheerful, is just the thing for Paddy, who under its influence
partakes of its spirit, and becomes soft, sweet, and
cheerful himself. The very tones of it act like a charm upon
him, and produce in his head such a bland and delightful intoxication,
that he finds himself making love just as naturally
as he would eat his meals. It opens all the sluices of his heart,
puts mercury in his veins, gives honey to a tongue that was,
Heaven knows, sufficiently sweet without it, and gifts him
with a pair of feather heels that Mercury might envy; and
to crown all, endows him, while pleading his cause in a quiet
corner, with a fertility of invention, and an easy unembarrassed
assurance, which nothing can surpass. In fact, with great
respect for my friend Mr Bunting, the fiddle it is that <em>ought</em>
to be our national instrument, as it is that which is most
closely and agreeably associated with the best and happiest
impulses of the Irish heart. The very language of the people
themselves is a proof of this; for whilst neither harp nor bagpipe
is ever introduced as illustrating peculiarities of feeling by
any reference to their influence, the fiddle is an agreeable instrument
in their hands, in more senses than one. Paddy’s
highest notion of flattery towards the other sex is boldly expressed
by an image drawn from it, for when he boasts that
he can, by honied words, impress such an agreeable delusion
upon his sweetheart as to make her imagine “that there is a
fiddler on every rib of the house,” there can be no metaphor conceived
more strongly or beautifully expressive of the charm
which flows from the tones of that sweet instrument. Paddy,
however, is very often hit by his own metaphor, at a time
when he least expects it. When pleading his cause, for instance,
and promising golden days to his fair one, he is not
unfrequently met by, “Ay, ay, it’s all very well now; you’re
sugary enough, of coorse; but wait till we’d be a year
married, an’ maybe, like so many others that promised what
you do, you’d never come home to me widout ‘hangin’ up your
fiddle behind the door;’” by which she means to charge him
with the probability of being agreeable when abroad, but
morose in his own family.</p>

<p>Having thus shown that the fiddle and its music are mixed
up so strongly with our language, feelings, and amusements,
it is now time to say something of the fiddler. In Ireland it
is impossible, on looking through all the classes of society, to
find any individual so perfectly free from care, or, in stronger
words, so completely happy, as the fiddler, especially if he be
blind, which he generally is. His want of sight circumscribes
his other wants, and, whilst it diminishes his enjoyments, not
only renders him unconscious of their loss, but gives a greater
zest to those that are left him, simple and innocent as they
are. He is in truth a man whose lot in life is happily cast,
and whose lines have fallen in pleasant places. The phase of
life which is presented to him, and in which he moves, is one
of innocent mirth and harmless enjoyment. Marriages, weddings,
dances, and merry-makings of all descriptions, create
the atmosphere of mirth and happiness which he ever breathes.
With the dark designs, the crimes, and outrages of mankind,
he has nothing to do, and his light spirit is never depressed
by their influence. Indeed, he may be said with truth to pass
through none but the festivals of life, to hear nothing but
mirth, to feel nothing but kindness, and to communicate nothing
but happiness to all around him. He is at once the
source and the centre of all good and friendly feelings. By
him the aged man forgets his years, and is agreeably cheated
back into youth; the labourer snatches a pleasant moment
from his toil, and is happy; the care-worn ceases to remember
the anxieties that press him down; the boy is enraptured
with delight, and the child is charmed with a pleasure that he
feels to be wonderful.</p>

<p>Surely such a man is important, as filling up with enjoyment
so many of the painful pauses in human misery. He is a
thousand times better than a politician, and is a true philosopher
without knowing it. Every man is his friend, unless it
be a rival fiddler, and he is the friend of every man, with the
same exception. Every house, too, every heart, and every
hand, is open to him; he never knows what it is to want a bed,
a dinner, or a shilling. Good heavens! what more than this
can the cravings of a human heart desire! For my part,
I do not know what others might aim at; but I am of opinion
that in such a world as this, the highest proof of a wise man
would be, a wish to live and die an Irish fiddler.</p>

<p>And yet, alas! there is no condition of life without some
remote or contingent sorrow. Many a scene have I witnessed
connected with this very subject, that would wring the tears
out of any eye, and find a tender pulse in the hardest heart.
It is indeed a melancholy alternative that devotes the poor
sightless lad to an employment that is ultimately productive
of so much happiness to himself and others. This alternative
is seldom resorted to, unless when some poor child&mdash;perhaps a
favourite&mdash;is deprived of sight by the terrible ravages of the
small-pox. In life there is scarcely any thing more touching
than to witness in the innocent invalid the first effects, both
upon himself and his parents, of this woeful privation. The
utter helplessness of the pitiable darkling, and his total dependence
upon those around him&mdash;his unacquaintance with the
relative situation of all the places that were familiar to him&mdash;his
tottering and timid step, and his affecting call of “Mammy,
where are you?” joined to the bitter consciousness on her
part that the light of affection and innocence will never sparkle
in those beloved eyes again&mdash;all this constitutes a scene of
deep and bitter sorrow. When, however, the sense of his
bereavement passes away, and the cherished child grows up
to the proper age, a fiddle is procured for him by his parents, if
they are able, and if not, a subscription is made up among their
friends and neighbours to buy him one. All the family, with
tears in their eyes, then kiss and take leave of him; and his mother,
taking him by the hand, leads him, as had been previously
arranged, to the best fiddler in the neighbourhood, with whom
he is left as an apprentice. There is generally no fee required,
but he is engaged to hand his master all the money he can
make at dances, from the time he is proficient enough to play
at them. Such is the simple process of putting a blind boy in
the way of becoming acquainted with the science of melody.</p>

<p>In my native parish there were four or five fiddlers&mdash;all
good in their way; but the Paganini of the district was the
far-famed Mickey M’Rorey. Where Mickey properly lived, I
never could actually discover, and for the best reason in the
world&mdash;he was not at home once in twelve months. As Colley
Cibber says in the play, he was “a kind of a here-and-thereian&mdash;a
stranger nowhere.” This, however, mattered little; for
though perpetually shifting day after day from place to place,
yet it somehow happened that nobody ever was at a loss where
to find him. The truth is, he never felt disposed to travel
<i lang="la">incog.</i>, because he knew that his interest must suffer by doing
so; the consequence was, that wherever he went, a little
nucleus of local fame always attended him, which rendered it
an easy matter to find his whereabouts.</p>

<p>Mickey was blind from his infancy, and, as usual, owed to
the small-pox the loss of his eyesight. He was about the
middle size, of rather a slender make, and possessed an intelligent
countenance, on which beamed that singular expression
of inward serenity so peculiar to the blind. His temper was
sweet and even, but capable of rising through the buoyancy of
his own humour to a high pitch of exhilaration and enjoyment.
The dress he wore, as far as I can remember, was always the
same in colour and fabric&mdash;to wit, a brown coat, a sober-tinted
cotton waistcoat, grey stockings, and black corduroys. Poor
Mickey! I think I see him before me, his head erect, as the
heads of all blind men are, the fiddle-case under his left arm,
and his hazel staff held out like a feeler, exploring with experimental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
pokes the nature of the ground before him, even
although some happy urchin leads him onward with an exulting
eye; an honour of which he will boast to his companions for
many a mortal month to come.</p>

<p>The first time I ever heard Mickey play was also the first
I ever heard a fiddle. Well and distinctly do I remember the
occasion. The season was summer&mdash;but summer <em>was</em> summer
then&mdash;and a new house belonging to Frank Thomas had been
finished, and was just ready to receive him and his family.
The floors of Irish houses in the country generally consist at
first of wet clay; and when this is sufficiently well smoothed
and hardened, a dance is known to be an excellent thing to
bind and prevent them from cracking. On this occasion the
evening had been appointed, and the day was nearly half advanced
but no appearance of the fiddler. The state of excitement
in which I found myself could not be described. The
name of Mickey M’Rorey had been ringing in my ears for God
knows how long, but I had never seen him, or even heard his
fiddle. Every two minutes I was on the top of a little eminence
looking out for him, my eyes straining out of their sockets,
and my head dizzy with the prophetic expectation of
rapture and delight. Human patience, however, could bear
this painful suspense no longer, and I privately resolved to
find Mickey, or perish. I accordingly proceeded across the
hills, a distance of about three miles, to a place called
Kilnahushogue, where I found him waiting for a guide. At
this time I could not have been more than seven years of age;
and how I wrought out my way over the lonely hills, or
through what mysterious instinct I was led to him, and that
by a path too over which I had never travelled before, must
be left unrevealed, until it shall please that Power which guides
the bee to its home, and the bird for thousands of miles
through the air, to disclose the principle upon which it is accomplished.</p>

<p>On our return home I could see the young persons of both
sexes flying out to the little eminence I spoke of, looking
eagerly towards the point we travelled from, and immediately
scampering in again, clapping their hands, and shouting with
delight. Instantly the whole village was out, young and
old, standing for a moment to satisfy themselves that the intelligence
was correct; after which, about a dozen of the
youngsters sprang forward, with the speed of so many antelopes,
to meet us, whilst the elders returned with a soberer but
not less satisfied manner into the houses. Then commenced
the usual battle, as to who should be honoured by permission
to carry the fiddle-case. Oh! that fiddle-case! For seven
long years it was an honour exclusively allowed to myself,
whenever Mickey attended a dance any where at all near us;
and never was the Lord Chancellor’s mace&mdash;to which, by the
way, with great respect for his lordship, it bore a considerable
resemblance&mdash;carried with a prouder heart or a more exulting
eye. But so it is&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“These little things are great to <em>little</em> men.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Blood alive. Mickey, you’re welcome!” “How is every
bone of you, Mickey? Bedad we gev you up.” “No, we
didn’t give you up, Mickey; never heed him; sure we knew
very well you’d not desart the Towny boys&mdash;whoo!&mdash;Fol de
rol lol.” “Ah, Mickey, won’t you sing ‘There was a wee
devil come over the wall?’” “To be sure he will, but wait
till he comes home and gets his dinner first. Is’t off an empty
stomach you’d have him to sing?” “Mickey, give me the fiddle-case,
won’t you, Mickey?” “No, to <em>me</em>, Mickey.” “Never
heed them, Mickey: you promised it to me at the dance in
Carntaul.”</p>

<p>“Aisy, boys, aisy. The truth is, none of yez can get the
fiddle-case. Shibby, my fiddle, hasn’t been well for the last day
or two, and can’t bear to be carried by any one barrin’ myself.”</p>

<p>“Blood alive! sick is it, Mickey?&mdash;an’ what ails her?”</p>

<p>“Why, some o’ the doctors says there’s a frog in her, an’
others that she has the cholic; but I’m goin’ to give her a
dose of balgriffauns when I get up to the house above. Ould
Harry Connolly says she’s with fiddle; an’ if that’s true, boys,
maybe some o’ yez won’t be in luck. I’ll be able to spare a
young fiddle or two among yez.”</p>

<p>Many a tiny hand was clapped, and many an eye was lit
up with the hope of getting a young fiddle; for gospel itself
was never looked upon to be more true than this assertion of
Mickey’s. And no wonder. The fact is, he used to amuse
himself by making small fiddles of deal and horse-hair, which
he carried about with him as presents for such youngsters as
he took a fancy to. This he made a serious business of, and
carried it on with an importance becoming the intimation just
given. Indeed, I remember the time when I watched one of
them, which I was so happy as to receive from him, day and
night, with the hope of being able to report that it was growing
larger; for my firm belief was, that in due time it would
reach the usual size.</p>

<p>As we went along, Mickey, with his usual tact, got out of
us all the information respecting the several courtships of the
neighbourhood that had reached us, and as much, too, of the
village gossip and scandal as we knew.</p>

<p>Nothing can exceed the overflowing kindness and affection
with which the Irish fiddler is received on the occasion of a
dance or merry-making; and to do him justice he loses no opportunity
of exaggerating his own importance. From habit,
and his position among the people, his wit and power of repartee
are necessarily cultivated and sharpened. Not one of
his jokes ever fails&mdash;a circumstance which improves his humour
mightily; for nothing on earth sustains it so much as knowing,
that, whether good or bad, it will be laughed at. Mickey, by
the way, was a bachelor, and, though blind, was able, as he
himself used to say, to see through his ears better than another
could through the eyes. He knew every voice at once,
and every boy and girl in the parish by name, the moment he
heard them speak.</p>

<p>On reaching the house he is bound for, he either partakes
of, or at least is offered, refreshment, after which comes the
ecstatic moment to the youngsters: but all this is done by due
and solemn preparation. First he calls for a pair of scissors,
with which he pares or seems to pare his nails; then asks for
a piece of rosin, and in an instant half a dozen boys are off at
a break-neck pace, to the next shoemaker’s, to procure it;
whilst in the meantime he deliberately pulls a piece out of his
pocket and rosins his bow. But, heavens! what a ceremony
the opening of that fiddle-case is! The manipulation of the
blind man as he runs his hand down to the key-hole&mdash;the turning
of the key&mdash;the taking out of the fiddle&mdash;the twang twang&mdash;and
then the first ecstatic sound, as the bow is drawn across
the strings; then comes a screwing; then a delicious saw or
two; again another screwing&mdash;twang twang&mdash;and away he
goes with the favourite tune of the good woman, for such is the
etiquette upon these occasions. The house is immediately
thronged with the neighbours, and a preliminary dance is taken,
in which the old folks, with good-humoured violence, are literally
dragged out, and forced to join. Then come the congratulations&mdash;“Ah,
Jack, you could do it wanst,” says Mickey,
“an’ can still; you have a kick in you yet.” “Why, Mickey, I
seen dancin’ in my time,” the old man will reply, his brow relaxed
by a remnant of his former pride, and the hilarity of the
moment, “but you see the breath isn’t what it used to be wid
me, when I could dance the <i>Baltehorum Jig</i> on the bottom of
a ten-gallon cask. But I think a glass o’ whisky will do us no
harm afther that. Heighho!&mdash;well, well&mdash;I’m sure I thought
<em>my</em> dancin’ days wor over.”</p>

<p>“Bedad an’ you wor matched any how,” rejoined the fiddler.
“Molshy carried as light a heel as ever you did; sorra a woman
of her years ever I seen could cut the buckle wid her. You
would know the tune on her feet still.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Mickey, the thruth is,” the good woman would say,
“we have no sich dancin’ now as there was in my days. Thry
that glass.”</p>

<p>“But as good fiddlers, Molshy, eh? Here’s to you both, and
long may ye live to shake the toe! Whoo! bedad that’s great
stuff. Come now, sit down. Jack, till I give you your ould favourite,
‘<i>Cannie Soogah</i>.’”</p>

<p>These were happy moments and happy times, which might
well be looked upon as picturing the simple manners of country
life with very little of moral shadow to obscure the cheerfulness
which lit up the Irish heart and hearth into humble happiness.
Mickey, with his usual good nature, never forgot the
younger portion of his audience. After entertaining the old
and full-grown, he would call for a key, one end of which he
placed in his mouth, in order to make the fiddle sing for the
children their favourite song, beginning with</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Oh! grand-mamma, will you squeeze my wig?”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This he did in such a manner, through the medium of the key,
that the words seemed to be spoken by the instrument, and not
by himself. After this was over, he would sing us, to his own
accompaniment, another favourite, “There was a wee devil
looked over the wall,” which generally closed that portion of the
entertainment so kindly designed for <em>us</em>.</p>

<p>Upon those moments I have often witnessed marks of deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
and pious feeling, occasioned by some memory of the absent or
the dead, that were as beautiful as they were affecting. If, for
instance, a favourite son or daughter happened to be removed
by death, the father or mother, remembering the air which was
loved best by the departed, would pause a moment, and with
a voice full of sorrow, say, “Mickey, there is <em>one tune</em> that I
would like to hear; I love to think of it, and to hear it; I do,
for the sake of them that’s gone&mdash;my darlin’ son that’s lyin’ low:
it was he that loved it. His ear is closed against it now; but
for <em>his</em> sake&mdash;ay, for your sake, avourneen machree&mdash;we will
hear it wanst more.”</p>

<p>Mickey always played such tunes in his best style, and amidst
a silence that was only broken by sobs, suppressed moanings,
and the other tokens of profound sorrow. These gushes, however,
of natural feeling soon passed away. In a few minutes the
smiles returned, the mirth broke out again, and the lively dance
went on as if their hearts had been incapable of such affection
for the dead&mdash;affection at once so deep and tender. But many
a time the light of cheerfulness plays along the stream of Irish
feeling, when cherished sorrow lies removed from the human
eye far down from the surface.</p>

<p>These preliminary amusements being now over, Mickey is
conducted to the dance-house, where he is carefully installed
in the best chair, and immediately the dancing commences.
It is not my purpose to describe an Irish dance here, having
done it more than once elsewhere. It is enough to say that
Mickey is now in his glory; and proud may the young man be
who fills the honourable post of his companion, and sits next
him. He is a living storehouse of intelligence, a travelling
directory for the parish&mdash;the lover’s text-book&mdash;the young
woman’s best companion; for where is the courtship going on
of which he is not cognizant? where is there a marriage on
the tapis, with the particulars of which he is not acquainted?
He is an authority whom nobody would think of questioning.
It is now, too, that he scatters his jokes about; and so correct
and well trained is his ear, that he can frequently name the
young man who dances, by the peculiarity of his step.</p>

<p>“Ah ha! Paddy Brien, you’re there? Sure I’d know the
sound of your smoothin’-irons any where. Is it thrue, Paddy,
that you wor sint for down to Errigle Keerogue, to kill the
clocks for Dan M’Mahon? But, nabuklish! Paddy, what’ll
you have?”</p>

<p>“Is that Grace Reilly on the flure? Faix, avourneen, you can
do it; devil o’ your likes I <em>see</em> any where. I’ll lay Shibby to a
penny trump that you could dance your own namesake&mdash;the
<i lang="ga">Calleen dhas dhun</i>, the bonny brown girl&mdash;upon a spider’s cobweb,
widout breakin’ it. Don’t be in a hurry, Grace dear, to
tie the knot; <em>I’ll</em> wait for you.”</p>

<p>Several times in the course of the night a plate is brought
round, and a collection made for the fiddler: this was the
moment when Mickey used to let the jokes fly in every direction.
The timid he shamed into liberality, the vain he praised,
and the niggardly he assailed by open hardy satire; all managed,
however, with such an under-current of good humour,
that no one could take offence. No joke ever told better than
that of the broken string. Whenever this happened at night,
Mickey would call out to some soft fellow, “Blood alive, Ned
Martin, will you bring me a candle?&mdash;I’ve broken a string.”
The unthinking young man, forgetting that he was blind, would
take the candle in a hurry, and fetch it to him.</p>

<p>“Faix, Ned. I knew you wor jist fit for’t; houldin’ a candle
to a dark man! Isn’t he a beauty, boys?&mdash;look at him, girls&mdash;as
cute as a pancake.”</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to say, that the mirth on such occasions
was convulsive. Another similar joke was also played off by
him against such as he knew to be ungenerous at the collection.</p>

<p>“Paddy Smith, I want a word wid you. I’m goin’ across
the counthry as far as Ned Donnelly’s, and I want you to help
me along the road, as the night is dark.”</p>

<p>“To be sure, Mickey. I’ll bring you over as snug as if you
wor on a clane plate, man alive!”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Paddy; throth you’ve the dacency in you; an’
kind father for you, Paddy. Maybe I’ll do as much for you
some other time.”</p>

<p>Mickey never spoke of this until the trick was played
off, after which, he published it to the whole parish; and
Paddy of course was made a standing jest for being so silly
as to think that night or day had any difference to a man who
could not see.</p>

<p>Thus passed the life of Mickey M’Rorey, and thus pass the
lives of most of his class, serenely and happily. As the sailor to
his ship, the sportsman to his gun, so is the fiddler attached
to his fiddle. His hopes and pleasures, though limited, are full.
His heart is necessarily light, for he comes in contact with the
best and brightest side of life and nature; and the consequence
is, that their mild and mellow lights are reflected on and from
himself. I am ignorant whether poor Mickey is dead or not;
but I dare say he forgets the boy to whose young spirit he
communicated so much delight, and who often danced with a
buoyant and careless heart to the pleasant notes of his fiddle.
Mickey M’Rorey, farewell! Whether living or dead, peace
be with you!</p>

<p>There is another character in Ireland essentially different
from the mere fiddler&mdash;I mean the country dancing-master. In
a future number of the Journal I will give a sketch of one who
was eminent in his line. Many will remember him when I name

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">Current Coin of China.</span>&mdash;The only coin made in China
is the tchen, or <em>cash</em>, as it is called in Canton. It is composed
of base metal, having the date and reigning emperor’s name
stamped on it. According to Gutzlaff, they had coins of this
description a thousand years before our era. It is nearly as
large as an old shilling. There is a square hole in the centre,
to admit of a number of them being strung on a bamboo.
From seven to eight hundred of these, according to the exchange,
may be had for a Spanish dollar. Silver is the commercial
medium of barter; it is not coined, but passes by
weight, after being purified, when it is called sycee silver. It
is then cast into lumps of one tael, or Chinese ounce, each,
the value of which in English money is about six shillings.
When decimal parts are required, it is cut. Spanish dollars
are current in Canton, and they are also cut when required
for lesser portions. Whenever one of these gets into the possession
of a Chinese, he stamps his name on it; hence in a
short time the Spanish marks become quite obliterated, and
then they are called chop dollars, and are melted into sycee
silver. Gold is like any other article of trade, and is not
used as a medium of barter.&mdash;<cite>Dr Fulton’s Travelling Sketches

<h2 class="gap4" id="EXTRAORDINARY_ANOMALY">EXTRAORDINARY ANOMALY.</h2>

<p class="center">BERNARD CAVANAGH.</p>

<p>In the hope that the narration of the following singular circumstances
may attract the attention of medical and scientific
men towards its extraordinary subject, we lay it before
the readers of the <cite>Irish Penny Journal</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<p>Bernard Cavanagh is about twenty-four years of age, and
now living with his parents at nearly a mile distant from
the little town of Swineford, county Mayo. The parents are
respectable, of reputable character, and in comfortable circumstances.
They assert&mdash;indeed they have made affidavits
before a magistrate of the county&mdash;that for nearly the last
four years he has existed without tasting sustenance of any
kind. They state also that from the 2d September 1836 to the
2d July 1840, he neither spoke nor rose from his bed except
to allow it to be arranged, during which operation he never
opened his mouth; and this portion of the statement is borne
out to a considerable extent by the fact of his having been
visited frequently, and at various periods, by persons of high
respectability as well as of the lower class, on all which occasions
he was observed invariably in the same position, with
his hands on his breast and his eyes fixed on the window.</p>

<p>The night before he betook himself to bed, he knocked at
the door of the priest’s house, and stated that he wished to
communicate something to him; but the reverend gentleman
declined admitting him, in consequence of the lateness of the
hour, saying that he could impart whatever he wished to state
on the morrow.</p>

<p>“But I will not be here to-morrow,” responded Cavanagh;
and he was right: the next day he took to his bed.</p>

<p>In the interval between September 1836 and the present season,
public attention on a limited scale was occasionally directed
towards Cavanagh. But the report of his utter and
continued abstinence from food was treated as a monstrous
fable by every one at any distance from his immediate locality,
and the extraordinary allegations respecting him were beginning
to fade from general recollection, when, to the utter astonishment
of every one in his neighbourhood, he arose from bed
and recovered his speech and powers of moving about; since
which time he continues, according to the accounts, without
sustenance in any shape, and has been visited by thousands
of persons from various quarters.</p>

<p>In boyhood, Cavanagh’s education extended barely as far as
the acquirement of reading and writing; but he constantly exhibited
strong marks of religious enthusiasm, often proceeding
to Meelick chapel (about three miles from his residence)
to one mass, and then attending another at his own parish
chapel of Swineford. It is said, too, that he at one time constructed
a sort of rude building for his private devotion in the
open fields, and repeatedly went to prayers at meal-times in
his father’s house, contenting himself with <em>one</em> meal in the day,
as if preparing himself for his total fast. Accordingly, since
resuming his speech and motion he haunts the chapel at all
hours by day and night, continuing for hours together apparently
in private prayer, and generally attended by a large
concourse of the peasantry, whom he addresses by fits and
starts, and many of whom are naturally, under the circumstances,
beginning to deem him not a human being at all, but
a shadow.</p>

<p>He seems not inclined to speak much, though he states he
has had “high visions.” His reply to the clergymen respecting
his revelations and fasting, is, that he is fed by the Word;
that he is not at liberty to detail his visions for the gratification
of man; and that no one should judge lest he be judged.</p>

<p>Cavanagh is about the middle height, of a grave emaciated
countenance; his motions are quite unembarrassed, and his
voice is sonorous and distinct when he speaks, which is still
but seldom, as he seems to utterly disregard his visitors, whatever
their rank.</p>

<p>As we said before, he continues daily to draw thousands of
the peasantry around him, who eagerly watch every word that
falls from his lips, as they place implicit faith in the assertion
that he has lived without any description of food for the last
four years, and of course regard him as something entirely
beyond the pale of ordinary humanity. <em>We</em> are, however,
not so easy of belief in a case so much at variance with the
ordinary regulations of nature; at the same time that we are
free to admit that it is hard to conceive what motive the young
man or his parents could have for carrying on such an imposition,
as the latter endeavoured at first to conceal the
matter altogether, and, in the next place, have repeatedly refused
money offered by their respectable visitors, though, in
fact, their means are a good deal diminished by the hospitality
extended to each successive guest; while a young sister, who
has constantly attended Cavanagh since he has lain and fasted
according to the statement, persists in declaring, with the
strongest appearance of innocence and belief in the truth of
her own assertion, that it was impossible he could have tasted
any thing during any part of that time unknown to her, and
that he never had.</p>

<p>That a person of narrow intellect and strong devotional
propensities should be seized with a religious monomania, and
that to a being of a weak mind and a debilitated frame strange
visions should occur, is perfectly comprehensible; but that
the frail materials of the human frame, which needs the nourishment
of food as much as the flower requires sunshine and
moisture, should endure for such a period without support, is
so unprecedented in all the records of mankind, and so contradictory
to the general laws of nature, that it would require
the most powerful proofs indeed to convince the intelligent
mind of its truth. We therefore again express our strong
hope that this slight sketch may produce the effect of having
Cavanagh’s case submitted to the test of eminent medical
skill&mdash;a test to which the parents profess their entire willingness
to assent, and thus a case of the grossest imposition be
detected, and thousands of simple beings disabused, or one
of the most extraordinary of nature’s anomalies be clearly
ascertained and exhibited.</p>

<p class="right">A.</p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">Scene in the Theatre at Leghorn.</span>&mdash;My time passed
delightfully while I remained in Leghorn. The Russian fleet
was at anchor in the Bay, commanded by Admiral O’Dwyer,
a distinguished seaman, and an Irishman by birth. The Storaces
and myself often went on board his ship, and were delighted
by hearing the Russians chaunt their evening hymn.
The melody is beautifully simple, and was always sung completely
in tune by this immense body of men. There was at
the same time in the harbour a privateer from Dublin, called
the Fame, Captain Moore: he and his first officer Campbell
were Irishmen, and had a fine set of Irish lads under them.
When Storace’s benefit took place, the officers and crew who
could be spared from their duty, to a man (and a famous sight
it was) marched to the theatre, and almost filled the par-terre.
At the end of the opera, Storace sang the Irish ballad
“Molly Astore,” at the conclusion of which, the boatswain
of the Fame gave a loud whistle, and the crew in a body
rose and gave three cheers. The dismay of the Italian part
of the audience was ludicrous in the extreme. The sailors
then sang “God save the King” in full chorus, and when done,
applauded themselves to the very skies: nothing could be
more unanimous or louder than their self-approbation.&mdash;<cite>Reminiscences
of Michael Kelly.</cite></p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">Truth.</span>&mdash;Truth is the foundation of virtue. An habitual
regard for it is absolutely necessary. He who walks by the
light of it has the advantage of the mid-day sun; he who
would spurn it, goes forth amid clouds and darkness. There
is no way in which a man strengthens his own judgment, and
acquires respect in society so surely, as by a scrupulous regard
to truth. The course of such an individual is right on
and straight on. He is no changeling, saying one thing to-day
and another to-morrow. Truth to him is like a mountain
landmark to the pilot: he fixes his eye upon a point that
does not move, and he enters the harbour in safety. On the
contrary, one who despises truth and loves falsehood is like a
pilot who takes a piece of drift-wood for his landmark, which
changes with every changing wave. On this he fixes his attention,
and, being insensibly led from his course, strikes upon
some hidden reef, and sinks to rise no more. Thus truth
brings success; falsehood results in ruin and contempt.&mdash;<cite>Dr
Channing.</cite></p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">Gaming.</span>&mdash;I look upon every man as a suicide from the
moment he takes the dice-box desperately in his hand; and
all that follows in his fatal career from that fatal time is only
sharpening the dagger before he strikes it to his heart.&mdash;<cite>Cumberland.</cite></p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
